\abstract{
According to Galison, the coordination of different ``subcultures'' within a scientific field happens through local exchanges within ``trading zones''. In his view, the workability of such trading zones is not guaranteed, and science is not necessarily driven towards further integration. In this paper, we develop and apply quantitative methods (using semantic, authorship, and citation data from scientific literature), inspired by Galison's framework, to the case of the disunity of high-energy physics. We give prominence to supersymmetry, a concept that has given rise to several major but distinct research programs in the field, such as the formulation of a consistent theory of quantum gravity or the search for new particles. We show that ``theory'' and `phenomenology'' in high-energy physics should be regarded as distinct theoretical subcultures, between which supersymmetry has helped sustain scientific ``trades''. However, as we demonstrate using a topic model, the phenomenological component of supersymmetry research has lost traction and the ability of supersymmetry to tie these subcultures together is now compromised. Our work supports that even fields with an initially strong commitment to unity may eventually generate diverging research programs and demonstrates the fruitfulness of the notion of trading zones for informing quantitative approaches to scientific pluralism.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

This paper focuses on \gls{hep}, the field of physics concerned with the fundamental entities of nature, and ``supersymmetry'', a symmetry between the two basic types of particles in nature. The idea of supersymmetry has brought together many of the most significant developments in the field throughout the past 50 years, all the way from the highly abstract world of string theorists, deep down to the machinery of under-ground particle colliders. However, none of the discoveries that supersymmetry promised have materialized as expected; as much as supersymmetry may be necessary to theorists seeking to unify the forces of nature into a coherent picture, it is increasingly plausible that it will not be of much use to the experimentalists looking to find new particles. Throughout this case study, therefore, our work exhibits the disunity of science, by demonstrating that even scientific fields that are strongly committed to unity, such as \gls{hep}, can eventually fail to coordinate research efforts. Our paper is guided by the idea that empirical case-studies, although seemingly narrow in scope, do enrich our understanding of the nature of scientific enterprise (in this case, the nature of the coordination of diverse scientific cultures), and that quantitative studies of science should provide conceptually informed tools for carrying out such case-studies, preferably in ways that can be generalized for a variety of contexts. %It is towards these two goals that we hope to progress in the present work. 

We start by presenting Galison's notions of subcultures and trading zones which is the framework for studying the plurality of science and the dynamics of interactions between scientific fields that underlies our investigation 
(\ref{section:galison}). We will then provide the necessary background knowledge for understanding the context of our case-study before laying out our hypotheses: i) that theory and phenomenology are to be regarded as two distinct theoretical subcultures within high-energy physics, ii) between which supersymmetry generated diverse research programs, iii) and which sustained successful trades until it was put in doubt by experimental data (\ref{section:hep_susy}). We will close our introduction by elaborating on our motivation for addressing these hypotheses through quantitative methods (\ref{section:quantitative}), at which point we will present the data, method, and results of our project.


\subsection{Subcultures and trading zones: Galison's approach to the plurality of science}\label{section:galison}

The fact that science is highly diverse is a challenge to those who, for various reasons\footnote{See \citealt{Hacking1996,Bechtel2007} for an overview of the various commitments underlying the Unity of Science ``ideology'' and of the attempts to unify the sciences.}, have sought to defend its unity. If science is indeed a unified enterprise, what is the nature of the relationship between fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, or economics? Can we translate all the concepts of these disciplines into a basic (say, physical) scientific language, as Carnap proposed? Or, are all these fields so incommensurable and autonomous that it is impossible to translate their respective entities, laws, and explanations from one's language to another's, as proponents of a pluralistic view defend (e.g. \citet{Suppes1978,Dupre1983,Cartwright1999})? Disciplines themselves can be so diverse, too, that the nature of what makes their own unity is not necessarily obvious. For instance, the nature of the unity of physics has been the matter of much debate, with sometimes serious political implications: reductionist views (which imply that high-energy physics are the most fundamental, since they supposedly entail any higher-level theory) were mobilized to justify the funding of large particle physics facilities \citep{Cat1998}, potentially to the detriment of more ``useful'' projects, as certain condensed-matter physicists argued \citep{martin2018solid}. As a result, the latter were most often proponents of ``methodological unity'', i.e. the idea that what bounds the field together is a shared commitment to a common set of norms rather than relations of logical deduction from the most fundamental to the least fundamental theories.

Even within one subfield, such as particle physics, the nature of the relationship between the objects manipulated by, say, experimentalists (for instance, tracks within a cloud-chamber, or electric signals from a sensor) and the more abstract entities manipulated by theorists (e.g. ``quarks'', ``gluons'', ``strings'', etc.) remains unclear. It is in order to address this challenge that Galison's concepts of subcultures and trading zones were developed \citep{galison1987how,galison1997image}, although these notions may apply more generally whenever different scientific communities attempt to overcome difficulties to communicate and achieve coordination \citep[p.~8]{Collins2010}. Consequently it is useful in a much broader range of contexts than the narrow case of physics; for instance, it is generally useful for studying the dynamics of interactions between disciplines in science\footnote{For instance, Digital History can be regarded as a trading zone \citep{Kemman2021}.}. Below, we propose a brief summary of the concepts of subcultures and trading zones and the rationale for their introduction.

The notion of subcultures was introduced by \citet{galison1987how,Galison1988} in order to account for two characteristics of high-energy physics: first, that it is subject to a strong division of labor, such that ``theory'', ``experiment'' and ``instrumentation'' are carried out by different groups of people \citep[p.~138]{galison1987how}, with very distinct skill sets, manipulating quite distinct bodies of knowledge; and second, that each of these ``subcultures'' are partially autonomous, i.e., none of them are completely subordinate to the others. We can highlight two tangible components of such subcultures: a social component--the community of practitioners--and a linguistic component--the language specific to each community.

For Galison, then, the question is what makes these subcultures part of a ``larger culture'' (physics), % such that ``physics [\dots] would neither be unified'', as in the reductionist picture, ``nor splintered into isolated fragments'' , as in a Kuhnian picture of incommensurable paradigms \citep[p.~782]{galison1987how}
while retaining that their successful coordination is a ``contingent matter'' \citep[p.~18]{galison1997image}; and his answer is ``trading zones''. Trading zones allow knowledge to be exchanged across different subcultures, inasmuch as the practitioners of distinct communities can locally agree on the usefulness of certain constructs despite the distinctiveness of their respective languages, commitments, aims, and methodologies. The trading within ``zones'' captures the fact that the exchange procedure is  ``local'' rather than ``global'', such that subcultures working out trades with each other can retain much of their autonomy in the process.%: ``in the local context of the trading zone, despite the differences in classification, significance, and standards of demonstration, the two groups can collaborate'' \citep[p.~803]{galison1997image}. %For Galison, the emergence of Monte-Carlo simulations in the context of the development of the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos is a paradigmatic illustration of the concept of a trading zone, between ``pure mathematician[s], applied mathematician[s], physicist[s], bomb builder[s], statistician[s], numerical analyst[s], \dots'' who thereby ``held a new cluster of skills in common, a new mode of producing scientific knowledge that was rich enough to coordinate highly diverse subject matter'' \citep{Galison1996}. More generally, 

What kinds of goods may be subject to these ``trades''? Examples of trade-able goods are ``boundary objects'', i.e. ``objects that are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites'' \citep[p.~393]{Star1989}\footnote{In the context of physics, Darrigol's theoretical modules may constitute another kind of trade-able good \citep[p.~214]{Darrigol2007}. One could consider multi-purpose scientific instruments \citep[pp.~179--182]{Shinn2005} as another example.}. Trading zones may give rise to a purposefully crafted inter-language that allows for further communication and coordination (a ``pidgin''). If the inter-language grows, it may turn into a full-blown language (a ``creole''); this signals the emergence and stabilization of a new scientific discipline of its own. 

Arguably, this is the process through which ``phenomenology'' -- a subfield of \gls{hep} at the boundary between theory and experiment -- has developed \citep[p.~837]{galison1997image}. However, we may wonder whether phenomenology is still merely dedicated to bridging the gap between the theoretical and experimental cultures or whether it acquired enough autonomy to depart from the supremacy of abstract theory. In the following subsection we will suggest treating ``theory'' and ``phenomenology'' in high-energy physics as two distinct subcultures, such that they may both enjoy considerable autonomy and eventually fail to coordinate their developments.

\subsection{Supersymmetry across theory and phenomenology}
\label{section:hep_susy}

\subsubsection{Theory and phenomenology as distinct subcultures within high-energy physics}

High-energy physics involves a complex web of mathematical and technical knowledge, whether it concerns the details of the often abstract underlying theories, the behavior of the instruments that are assembled within sophisticated experiments, statistical notions for the analysis of the data derived from these experiments, etc. As a result of this complexity, labor is strongly divided within high-energy physics, and we can distinguish two different groups within the theorists themselves.  While ``pure'' theorists (we will call them ``theorists'', in accordance with the terminology within the field) are driven by ``the abstract elaboration of respectable theories'', phenomenologists (the second kind of theorists) are often more concerned with ``the application of less dignified models to the analysis of data and as a
guide to further experiment'' \citep{pickering1984constructing}, or at least more concerned with experimental consequences rather than with high theory. This division is itself strong enough that these two kinds of physicists can generally receive different training and diverge early in their careers, although some physicists -- usually prominent ones -- have expertise in both these domains and are able to sustain exchanges between the two. Therefore, in the present paper, we will make the following claim:

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Claim 1}: The categories ``theory'' and ``phenomenology'' in high-energy physics should be regarded as distinct subcultures with their own bodies of knowledge, ontologies and methodologies, and which are carried out by different people.
\end{quote}

 It is not controversial in itself that ``theory'' and ``phenomenology'' are different matters in \gls{hep}; these are distinct categories within the \gls{hep} literature and it is not uncommon for physicists to label themselves as ``theorists'' or ``phenomenologists'' depending on their specialization. However, our claim goes further by stating that the nature of their work is \textit{so} distinct that it should not be assumed \textit{a priori} that they can sustain fruitful connections; per Galison, we should not expect \textit{a priori} that subcultures are bound to cooperate flawlessly under any circumstance; we should instead remain open to the possibility that they may fail to produce constructs of shared value within the contexts of their respective enterprises. There may not even be one single overarching goal that is equally shared and sought after by \gls{hep} theorists and phenomenologists, and it is even less certain that their respective methods should equally contribute to achieving their goals at any time\footnote{\citealt{Galison1995} provides a distinction between two kinds of theorists similar to the one we propose to make here, resting on the recognition that these two groups rely on very different sets of constraints as guides towards theoretical progress.}. In the following subsection, we will propose that supersymmetry exemplifies the contingent ability of high-energy physicists to coordinate their respective methods and goals in a successful way. It does so because the story of supersymmetry is that of a partial failure, rather than that of a total success. Although successful cases of cross-fertilization across fields are valuable to illustrate the notion of trading zones, the disunity of science is better exemplified by those cases where scientific cultures fail to establish coordination, especially when such coordination was believed to be possible and is actively sought after. The dramatic story of supersymmetry provides such an example.

 % [It might be that phenomenology has little to say about unification or quantum gravity physics; it does not mean that these physics are completely unconstrained, such that the theorists approach is perflectly legitimate.]

\subsubsection{Supersymmetry as a trade-able good between theory and phenomenology}

Supersymmetry is a symmetry that relates the two fundamental kinds of particles that arise in nature: fermions and bosons. It was postulated simultaneously and independently by several physicists in the early 1970s, who were each motivated by very different goals\footnote{%In the West, \citet{Gervais1971} and \citet{Neveu1971} introduced supersymmetry as part of an attempt to improve the so-called ``dual models'' of hadronic interactions, i.e. those interactions that result from the ``strong force''. In the East, \citet{Golfand1971} and \citet{Volkov1973} discovered supersymmetry in the context of quantum field theory, the now dominant background theory in the field. The former stressed that supersymmetry could lead to a violation of parity invariance, i.e. mirror symmetry, while the latter introduced supersymmetry in order to explain the masslessness of the neutrino.
For a history of early supersymmetry, see \citealt{kane2000the}.}. Supersymmetry rapidly gathered substantial attention from the theoretical community. The reasons were manifold, but they were clearly theoretical rather than empirical, as early reviews of the topic show\footnote{\citealt{Fayet1976cr,Freedman1978zi,Taylor1983su} provide a good overview of the main arguments for supersymmetry in its early days, all of which are highly theoretical.}. First, symmetry principles play a fundamental role in High-Energy physics, and supersymmetry was an especially attractive symmetry because of its peculiar properties%\footnote{``The lesson we have learned from the impact of supersymmetry in the physics of particles and fields is [\dots] a richer algebraic structure [\dots] in which possibly internal and space—time symmetries are [\dots] unified'' \citep{Fayet1976cr}; ``At the global level, supersymmetry is the only invariance [symmetry] compatible with quantum field theory which unifies particles of different spin and internal quantum numbers'' \citep{Freedman1978zi}; ``Initial interest in this symmetry grew rapidly both because it apparently allowed an intertwining of space-time symmetries and internal symmetries'' \citep{Taylor1983su}}.
. Second, supersymmetry can naturally give rise to gravity, as was observed by \citet{Volkov1973}, suggesting that it could lead to a consistent theory of quantum gravity. This feature of supersymmetry gave birth to an entire research program, ``supergravity'', which then spanned several decades\footnote{Later on, supersymmetry proved even more interesting to theorists, by improving the consistency of string theory, and by supporting the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence, yet another major development in quantum gravity research.}. Third, while quantum field theory is prone to mathematical difficulties due to divergences appearing in the perturbative calculations of certain quantities, in many instances such infinities were suppressed in supersymmetric theories.%, as many contributions to these divergences would cancel each other out. 

However, as appealing as it was to theorists, supersymmetry posed a number of empirical difficulties. First, supersymmetry establishes a symmetry between bosons and fermions; and yet, at first it was not  at all clear which of the bosons and fermions should have been related to each other by this symmetry. Moreover, if supersymmetry were perfectly realized in nature, the particles it relates should have identical masses, which was also in contradiction with the data. This contradictory situation was well summarised by \citet{Witten1982de} in his \textit{Introduction to supersymmetry}: 

\begin{quote}
    %Supersymmetry is a remarkable subject that has fascinated particle physicists since it was originally introduced.
    %Although supersymmetry is no longer a new idea, we still do not know in what form, if any, it plays a role in the proper description of nature. [\dots]
    [Supersymmetry] is a fascinating mathematical structure, and a reasonable extension of current ideas, but plagued with phenomenological difficulties. [...] Supersymmetry is a very beautiful idea, but I think it is fair to say that no one knows what mysteries of nature (if any) it should explain.
\end{quote}

Still, efforts to incorporate supersymmetry into a theory consistent with the data were undertaken over several years, and they culminated in what is now called the \gls{mssm} \citep{Fayet1976cr,Dimopoulos1981}. The \gls{mssm} is the result of reconciling the achievements of the \gls{sm} (the best theoretical account available at the time and still today) with the requirement of supersymmetry. This, however, has very undesirable consequences. Compared to the \gls{sm}, the \gls{mssm} introduces 105 additional unspecified parameters, so that supersymmetry can accommodate a large range of observations and has little predictive power in general. In particular, although supersymmetry predicts the existence of many new particles (the ``superpartners''), there is \textit{a priori} little chance  that these particles will have just the right properties to be discoverable in experiments. If not, supersymmetry may be of high value to theorists (because of its mathematical properties, and its promise to achieve a coherent account of quantum gravity), while being of low value to phenomenologists who are interested in building predictive models that can lead to the discovery of new particles or phenomena\footnote{Supersymmetry suffers from other disadvantages. For instance, many parameters of the theory imply certain phenomena to extents that have not been observed, e.g., baryon and lepton number violation, or flavor changing neutral currents \citep{weinberg1995the}, which requires \textit{ad-hoc} explanations as to why, although allowed by the model, these mechanisms do not occur in nature.}.

Yet, in 2011, supersymmetry was perceived across the field as the theory beyond the \gls{sm} that was most likely to manifest itself in experiments \citep{Mttig2019,Mttig2020a}. Arguably, the reason why it became highly credible and valuable to phenomenologists as well, was that it could solve the so-called ``naturalness'' problem of the standard model on the condition that it was discoverable. %One interpretation could be that the field of high-energy physics is dominated by theory, such that theoretical physicists have been able to impose their own values and beliefs onto phenomenologists and experimentalists.
In parallel to these developments around supersymmetry, there was indeed increasing recognition that an explanation was required as to why the the mass of the Higgs boson (an important piece of the Standard Model) could be many orders of magnitude below the mass scale at which the unification of forces is assumed to take place. 
%\gls{sm} suffered from a problem associated to 1) the presence of the Higgs boson, which ``gives the particles their mass'' and 2) the expectation of some higher theory that would unify the fundamental forces of nature that would manifest itself at an energy scale much above that of the \gls{sm}. As these assumptions were made, then it seemed that a mechanism was required in order to ``stabilize'' the Higgs mass at the scale at which it was expected to lie.
It was also realized that supersymmetry could provide an answer to this ``naturalness''  problem (\citealt{Weinberg1978,Veltman1980,Witten1982de}), \textit{but} only as long as the masses of the superpartners (the particles predicted by supersymmetry) are not too high, so that they should be discoverable in future experiments\footnote{One can put other constraints on the \gls{mssm}, by requiring that supersymmetry explains dark matter, or that it ensures the convergence of the ``couplings'' that measure the strength of the fundamental forces at different length scales, which suggests it should play a role in the unification of these forces. However, as \citealt{Giudice2004} put it, ``the unification and dark-matter arguments [for supersymmetry] are not in general sufficient to insure that new physics be within the LHC discovery reach, contrary to the naturalness criterion''.}. In light of this, supersymmetry became of very high value to phenomenologists and experimentalists as well, rather than just a mathematical toy for the theorists to play with\footnote{The naturalness argument also provides a ``narrative'' that connects what theorists are concerned with (the details of the theories at energy scales unattainable in the experiment) to what experimentalists can probe. As \citet[p.~76]{Borrelli2015} puts it, ``the strength of the naturalness narrative is largely due to its flexibility, which allows it to become a unifying factor in the high-energy community and to bridge the gap between theorists and experimenters''  }.

    \caption{\textbf{Supersymmetry in the trading zone between theory and phenomenology.} Theorists and phenomenologists have different aims and methodologies, and whether they can both positively appraise a particular construct is not guaranteed. In the case of supersymmetry, it is the naturalness requirement that ensures that the \gls{mssm} is so valuable to both subcultures. As a result supersymmetry enhances a trading zone between these two cultures.  }
    \label{fig:mssm}
\end{figure*}

This situation is summarised in Figure \ref{fig:mssm}. As theorists work out a path towards their goals (e.g., the unification of forces, or the formulation of a consistent theory of quantum gravity), they rely on theoretical heuristics such as renormalizability, symmetry principles, consistency requirements, etc. \citep{Galison1995}. In that context, supersymmetry emerges as a very valuable concept. Phenomenologists, on the other hand, try to work out a path towards the discovery of ``new physics'' (evidence for new phenomena unaccounted for by the \gls{sm}) by relying instead on more generic models and constraints derived from experimental data (e.g. from particle colliders or astrophysical observations). It is the naturalness requirement that makes supersymmetry valuable to phenomenologists as well, by strengthening the belief that supersymmetric particles should have masses that are low enough to be discoverable. In this way, supersymmetry effectively enhances the ``trading zone'' between theorists and phenomenologists: both communities can acknowledge its value in spite of the vast differences in their aims, methods, and objects of inquiry.%In that sense, supersymmetry constitues a ``boundary object'' at the interface of distinct cultures. %That theorists and phenomenologists can both value supersymmetry for very different reasons and purposes should appear in the way supersymmetry arises within their research.

It is now time to introduce the last (but not the least) player in our drama: the \gls{lhc}. Operating since 2010, the \gls{lhc} is the largest physics experiment ever built. By performing particle collisions at the highest energies ever achieved, it promised to discover supersymmetric particles, provided that they had the properties prescribed by the naturalness problem that supersymmetry should solve. However, no such discovery has been made, which suggests that the ``naturalness problem'' was unwarranted \citep{Giudice2017}. If there is no naturalness problem, then, supersymmetry is left unconstrained again; there is no guarantee that supersymmetric particles will ever be discovered; and its phenomenological value plunges back to the depths from which it surfaced. Therefore we will put forward the following claim, which will also be evaluated in the present paper:

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Claim 2}: Supersymmetry occurs in a variety of partially independent contexts within high-energy physics, some of which belong to ``theory'' and some of which belong to ``phenomenology'', and these applications of supersymmetry have responded differently to the \gls{lhc}'s failure to find supersymmetric particles.
\end{quote}

Consequently supersymmetry should be losing its ability to sustain trades between theory and phenomenology. Therefore, we will evaluate the following claim:
 
\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Claim 3}: Supersymmetry sustained trades between theory and phenomenology in high-energy physics, until it was challenged by the \gls{lhc}'s failure to observe the particles predicted by supersymmetry.
\end{quote}

If theorists and phenomenologists fail to share a similar appraisal of supersymmetry, then this may pose a serious problem for the field: this would imply that theorists' research programs no longer provide useful guidance to phenomenologists, and conversely that experimental input has little impact on theorists; if that is the case, then the unity of high-energy physics would indeed be fragilized. Therefore, addressing  claims 1-3 (that theory and phenomenology are partially autonomous subcultures of high-energy physics; that supersymmetry arises in distinct, autonomous contexts, which responded differently to the absence of supersymmetric particles at the \gls{lhc}; and that the value of supersymmetry for bridging together subcultures of physics has decreased as a result) should contribute to answering the questions of what makes and unmakes unity in \gls{hep}.% in the present paper.

\subsection{Towards a quantitative assessment of subcultures and trades}
\label{section:quantitative}

In the following, we propose an array of quantitative methods implementing several dimensions of Galison's framework for addressing the plurality of science, which evaluate the claims put forward above. To this end, we will rely on authorship data (for investigating the social entrenchment of theory and phenomenology as distinct subcultures), semantic analyses (for investigating the linguistic divide between these subcultures as well as the plurality of supersymmetry research), and citation data (in order to locate ``trading zones'' within the field). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to implement Galison's framework into a quantitative analysis of the scientific literature. Of course, the plurality of science and the coordination between scientific fields have already been addressed quantitatively in numerous publications. In the context of physics research, for instance, \citet{Battiston2019} have evaluated the ability of physicists to publish in various subfields. In particular, they demonstrate that \gls{hep} physicists are among the most specialized physicists (i.e., they have a high probability of publishing only in their primary subfield), although their work does not distinguish between the various kinds of high-energy physicists, which will be done in the present paper. There remains to address the linguistic component of the divide between these subcultures, in particular theory and phenomenology, and to this end we will propose a novel strategy based on semantic data (titles and abstracts of the literature).

As for the analysis of the plurality of supersymmetry-related research in \gls{hep}, we will develop a topic model approach in order to identify heterogeneous clusters of concepts that are most likely to be associated with supersymmetry in the literature, and we will explore their dynamics throughout time.

Finally, we will assess the intensity of trades between theoretical subcultures and locate the concepts that facilitate these trades. \citet{Yan2013} proposed a quantitative assessment of dependency relations between scientific disciplines based around a metaphor with international trade, by measuring quantities such as ``exports'', ``imports'', or ``self-dependence'' of various fields throughout time based on citation data. However, this work does not investigate what exactly allows these trades to happen, e.g., which concepts sustain them. This requires combining citation data with semantic information about papers' concepts, as achieved by \citet{Raimbault2019} who proposed measures of interdisciplinarity built upon such data. Similarly to \citealt{Yan2013}, we will assess the self-dependence of experiment, phenomenology, and theory in \gls{hep} based on the citation network. However, we will also evaluate the ability of different concepts (such as supersymmetry) to sustain trades across subcultures throughout time, by combining semantic and citation data.
%Similarly, \citet{Aleta2019} have assessed the physicists' capacity for exploring varyingly dissimilar topics in a longitudinal analysis relying on a fine-grained classification scheme of the physics literature.

 % First, semantic analyses will be used to explore the linguistic component of the divide between subcultures, but also the plurality of research involved around a certain concept -- in our case, supersymmetry. Second, semantic analyses will be combined with the analysis of the citation network in order to evaluate the extent of trades between subcultures throughout time depending on the concepts that help sustain these trades.

More broadly, this works will add to quantitative studies of science literature, by helping to fill a gap that has come to the attention of the community.  As stressed by \citet{Kang2020,Leydesdorff2020,Bowker2020}, quantitative and qualitative studies of science have mostly diverged in their goals and ``world views'', urging the need to ``bridge the gap'' between them. We propose, therefore, a bridge connecting these two forms of scientific study. First, we demonstrate that quantitative methods can address questions raised by the philosophy, history, and sociology of physics. Moreover, we show that concepts from qualitative 
 science studies can give structure to quantitative methods, in line with the call by \citealt{Heinze2020} to inform quantitative analyses with ``middle-range theories'' (of which Galison's trading zones are an example). As a result, our methods can be applied to much more diverse contexts than the case-study proposed in this paper.%For that, we deploy a range of methods informed by our conceptual framework, that can be applied to scientific literature at large.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{section:data} describes the data on which our analysis rests and how it was collected. Section \ref{section:method} details the quantitative methods that were deployed in order to address each of the three claims put forward in the introduction. The first subsection (\ref{section:method_subcultures}) elaborates quantitative methods for assessing the level of semantic and social autonomy of certain categories (subcultures), and applies these methods to the two theoretical subcultures in \gls{hep}. The second subsection (\ref{section:method_plurality}) elaborates a methodology based on topic models in order to address the ``plasticity'' and ``plurality'' of supersymmetry, which can in principle be applied to all ``boundary objects'', i.e. those objects that can be traded between distinct subcultures while preserving and sustaining their distinctness. The third subsection (\ref{section:method_trading_zone}) provides a quantitative model for locating ``trading zones'' or more broadly concepts that enhance trades between subcultures (or scientific disciplines in general), and applies the model to the exchanges between the theoretical subcultures of \gls{hep}. Section \ref{section:application} reveals and interprets the results of these analyses. Finally, Section \ref{section:discussion} explores the consequences of this work, both for our case study (supersymmetry within \gls{hep}) and for the more general question of the plurality of science from a quantitative perspective.

\section{Data\label{section:data}}

% \subsection{\label{section:source}Source}

Our data consists of the scientific literature on high-energy physics and the semantic, authorship, and citation information that it entails which is of interest for our questions.
 
The data were retrieved using the Inspire HEP database \citep{InspireAPI}. Inspire HEP is a platform dedicated to the HEP community and is maintained by members of CERN, DESY, Fermilab and SLAC. It aggregates publications from the \gls{hep} literature, and maintains a list of institutions and collaborations involved in the community, while also publishing job offers. It replaced SPIRES in 2012\footnote{``Physicists, start your searches: INSPIRE database now online'', \textit{Symmetry}, May 24th 2012, \url{https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2012/05/24/physicists-start-your-searches-inspire-database-now-online}
}.

The database is fed by an automatic aggregator that retrieves articles from multiple sources\footnote{Melissa Clegg, ``INSPIRE Content Sources
'', May 30th 2020 (\url{https://help.inspirehep.net/knowledge-base/inspire-content-sources/})} including a number of databases (including the Astrophysics Data System, arXiv, etc.), research institutions (CERN, DESY, Fermilab, IHEP, IN2P3, SLAC), and scientific editors such as the American Physics Society or Springer.

Inspire then aggregates data from these sources with automated crawlers, and it performs manual curation for completion or error-correction\footnote{Stella Christodoulaki, ``Content Policy'', March 4th 2020, \url{https://help.inspirehep.net/knowledge-base/content-policy/}}, including author name disambiguation. This database has a strong yet untapped potential for quantitative analyses. However, only contents related to HEP are subject to a systematic effort of collection and curation, and the data should be used preferably in analyses which scope is limited to HEP, thereby making it unsuitable for, e.g., studying interactions between HEP and other fields of physics (e.g. condensed matter physics).%The database contains a significant fraction of Astrophysics papers; however, those are not representative of the field.

The database includes data about the contents of the literature (title, summary, sometimes keywords), the authors (name, unique identifier, institutional affiliations), dates corresponding to different events related to each paper, associated experiments, references of the articles. The only data pertaining to the contents of the articles that are consistently available are titles and abstracts. Most articles are categorized according to a classification scheme mostly built upon arXiv's. This scheme includes categories such as \texttt{Theory-HEP}, \texttt{Experiment-HEP}, \texttt{Phenomenology-HEP}, \texttt{Astrophysics}, etc., and it relies on arXiv's categories for articles that are available on that platform, adding manual curation when they are not. A portion of the articles between the years 1990 to 1995 were not categorized, which led to some issues with the data collection process, as described in Appendix \ref{appendix:collection}. For this reason, we have not conducted longitudinal analyses that included this date range. This however did not prevent us from addressing our research questions.

\section{Method}\label{section:method}

\subsection{Social and semantic analysis of subcultures of high-energy physics}\label{section:method_subcultures}

The first claim that we seek to establish is that ``theory'' and ``phenomenology'' should both be regarded as distinct subcultures within physics. There are two components to subcultures: a linguistic one (they should have vocabularies that are distinct enough to signal complementary bodies of knowledge) and a social one (they should correspond to distinct groups of people). Therefore we will proceed twofold. First, we will demonstrate that theory and phenomenology manipulate vocabularies that are so distinct that we can predict with reasonable accuracy whether a paper belongs to one of these categories based on the words present in its abstract, and this predictive model will also be used to unveil the ontological differences between these subcultures. Second, we will show that these categories from the literature are associated with different communities.

\subsubsection{The semantic divide between Theory and Phenomenology}

If it is possible to tell whether a paper is theoretical or phenomenological based on the vocabulary it contains, then this implies that these categories use partially distinct ``languages''. In order to establish whether we can predict which articles $d$ belong to any of the categories $c \in \{$Experiment, Phenomenology, Theory$\}$, we will build a simple linear logistic regression using a bag-of-words as the predictive features. In this approach, the corpus is represented by a matrix $B=(b_{d,i}) \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times V}$ where $D$ is the amount of documents, $V$ is the size of the vocabulary, and $b_{d,i}$ is the number of occurrences of the word (or expression\footnote{We also include some n-grams in the model, i.e. expressions of several words, provided they follow certain pre-defind syntactic patterns (e.g. ``adjective +noun'')}) $i$ in the document $d$. This representation excludes a lot of semantic information that results from the knowledge of the ordering of the words and the structure of sentences within the documents; it is in line with our goal to find out whether the vocabularies of each category are so distinct that the mere presence or absence of certain words can be used to infer the category of a document. We perform a normalization of the bag-of-words prior to the regression, by applying the tf-idf transformation\footnote{For a definition of the tf-idf transformation, and information theoretic justifications of its relevance, see \citealt{Beel2015_tfidf_uses,Robertson2004_tfidf_justification}. We use scikit-learn's implementation of the inverse-document frequency transformation which is $\text{idf} = 1+\log(1/f)$ where $f$ is the fraction of documents in which a word occurs. It differs from the ``textbook'' definition $\log(1/f)$ because of the regularization term ($+1$).} to $(b_{d,i})$, resulting in a normalized bag-of-words which we will name $(b_{d,i}')$. The resulting predictive model is then given by:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:logistic_bow_classifier}
    P(d\in c) = \mathrm{logit}^{-1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^V \beta_{ci} b'_{di}  \right)
\end{equation}

This model is then trained on $N=50,000$ articles of our database that belong to any of the following categories: \texttt{Experiment-HEP}, \texttt{Phenomenology-HEP}, and \texttt{Theory-HEP}\footnote{The fit is performed with the scikit-learn python library \citep{scikit-learn}.}. The vocabulary used in the regression is the $V$ expressions (n-grams) among those that belong to predefined syntactic patterns (up to three word long), that have the highest ``unithood'' as measured in \citealt{omodei_tel-01097702}\footnote{The ``unithood'' measures ``the degree of strength or stability of syntagmatic combinations or collocations'' \citep{Kageura1996}}. The size of the vocabulary $V$ is chosen to be a round number that is just high enough to reach about the maximum accuracy of the model, as evaluated on the test set (which consists in 10,000 articles not present in the training set). Then, the accuracy of the predictions of the model are evaluated using the same test set. The coefficients $\beta_{ci}$ are then analyzed in order to extract the words that are the most discriminatory between ``theory'' and ``phenomenology'', thus revealing the most salient differences. For that, we retrieve those expressions $i$ that maximize $\beta_{\text{th},i}-\beta_{\text{ph},i}$ and $\beta_{\text{ph},i}-\beta_{\text{th},i}$. Because of the inverse document frequency transformation applied prior to the regression, expressions that are more common are favored by this selection process.

\subsubsection{The social divide between Theory and Phenomenology}

What does it mean to say that theory and phenomenology have a ``demographic component'', as  \citet[p.~138]{galison1987how} puts it, regarding theory and experiment in \gls{hep}? It means that these categories of the literature are supplied by distinct groups of people, ``theorists'' and ``phenomenologists''. Therefore, we will investigate whether it is the case that experimental, phenomenological and theoretical papers are published by three distinct groups of physicists, such that these physicists usually contribute mostly to just one of these categories. We include ``experiment'' in our analysis, since it will be useful to assess whether the distinction between phenomenology and theory is as strong as the distinction between theory and experiment (the one initially stressed by Galison).

Let $N_{ij}$ be the amount of articles co-authored by a physicist $i$ that belong to the category $j \in \{$theory, phenomenology, experiment$\}$, and $N_i$ the total amount of articles co-authored by $i$. Let us assume $N_{ij} \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_{ij})$, where $p_{ij}$ is the latent probability that a paper from physicist $i$ belongs to the category $j$\footnote{Since these categories are not mutually exclusive in our database (an article may belong to more than one of them), a multinomial process would not be a good fit.}. Since the researchers co-authored widely varying amounts of publications (ranging from a few papers to hundreds), we assumed that the latent probabilities $p_{ij}$ were described by the following model:

\begin{align*}
    N_{ij} &\sim \mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_{ij})\\
    p_{ij} &\sim \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha_j, \beta_j) \\
    \alpha_j,\beta_j &\sim \mathrm{Exponential}(1)
\end{align*}

Indeed, this model allows to combine information from researchers with many papers and researchers with very papers; for those with few papers, the estimation of the latent probabilities is more influenced by the shape of the Beta distribution. The model was fitted to 2500 researchers randomly sampled among those with more than 3 publications in HEP for 1980-2020. In order to evaluate the social entrenchment of these categories, we verify that most physicists contribute mostly to just one of these categories.

\subsection{Assessing the plurality of supersymmetry research with topic models}\label{section:method_plurality}

Our second claim pertains to the plurality of supersymmetry research. In this section, we present our methodology for assessing the plurality of supersymmetry related research, by recovering the contexts, i.e., the topics in which supersymmetry occurs, and by evaluating the extent of their independence, and how they responded to the results of the \gls{lhc}. More broadly we provide a methodology for investigating scientific ``objects'' akin to ``boundary objects'' in that they are ``plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them'' \citep[p.~393]{Star1989}, by unveiling the plurality and autonomy of the contexts in which such objects may arise.

\subsubsection{Model}

In order to evaluate in which contexts supersymmetry arises within the high-energy physics literature, we have chosen to subdivide the literature into sub-topics using an unsupervised probabilistic topic model, namely the Correlated Topic Model (CTM, \citealt{Blei2007}). We do not use conventional classifications such as the \gls{pacs} codes from the\gls{aip}, because they were not available for the whole dataset -- \gls{pacs} codes were only available starting from 1995, and only for a subset of the papers, which may not be representative of the whole. Besides, \gls{pacs} codes are too numerous (more than 5000 categories)\footnote{``Full list of PACS numbers'', \textit{
Physics-Uspekhi}, \url{https://ufn.ru/en/pacs/all/}} for our purposes. Therefore, we opted to extract the topics in the literature using unsupervised topic models instead. %In our case, since we would like to develop and probe methods that may be applied more systematically to other domains, including those for which such classification schemes may be lacking, it seemed more relevant to avoid using those categories at all. For this reason, we have decided to resort to unsupervised classification methods, i.e. methods that learn topics from the data (in our case, from the abstracts of the papers, since the full texts are not consistently available). 

Probabilistic topic models generally assume that each document of a corpus is a mixture of variable proportions of a certain amount of topics, each of these topics having their own vocabulary distribution. When trained on a corpus, such models simultaneously learn the ``topics'' in the corpus (and their vocabulary), as well as the relative contribution of each topic to each document of the corpus. %Figure \ref{fig:example_topic_voc_dist} illustrates a topic recovered from a probabilistic model of topic detection, in particular the frequency of the top 30 terms associated to that topic. Inspecting this distribution allows to label each topic with its own description. Figure  \ref{fig:example_articles_topic_dist} shows the proportion of each top-5 topics for 3 articles that mention supersymmetry in their title that were selected at random.
These models have demonstrated their ability to capture the semantic information contained within the scientific and academic literature, as shown in previous work\footnote{Notable examples are \citealt{Nichols2014,Hall2008,Griffiths2004}; see \citealt{Malaterre2022} for a more recent application in the context of History and Philosophy of Science, and \citealt{Allen2022} for an assessment of the potential and limitations of these methods in the field.}, even from abstracts alone\citep{Syed2017}; as a result this technique has seemingly taken precedence over network-based semantic maps \citep[Figure~1]{Leydesdorff2016}. Topic models provide a straightforward derivation of the information that is of interest to us: the vocabulary associated to each ``topic'', and the contribution of each ``topic'' to each document of a corpus. Although co-occurrence networks may have more bearing in the STS tradition, we have preferred topic models for their intrinsic ability to capture the polysemy of certain words (e.g., ``supersymmetry''), in terms of the probabilities that such words can arise in different contexts (i.e. topics).

% Les modèles probabilistes de détection de sujet présentent en effet plusieurs avantages, en particulier leur interprétabilité (ils peuvent être compris dans un langage probabiliste relativement simple) et leur succès à capturer l'information sémantique contenue dans la littérature scientifique comme en témoignent de nombreux travaux (e.g. \citealt{Savov2020,Hall2008,Griffiths2004}). En outre, sur de suffisamment grands corpus, la qualité des sujets dérivés de ces modèles à partir de résumés d'articles est comparable à celle atteinte en recourant aux textes complets \citep{Syed2017}. L'intérêt croissant pour ces techniques \citep[Figure~1]{Leydesdorff2016} et leur flexibilité (les modèles peuvent être complexifiés pour se rapprocher de la structure des corpus, ou pour intégrer des dynamiques temporelles) sont d'autres arguments qui justifient de se tourner vers elles. Les modèles probabilistes permettent de dériver immédiatement les informations qui nous intéressent : le vocabulaire de chaque sujet, et le poids des sujets pour chaque document. La disponibilité d'implémentations performantes et largement testées de ces modèles nous permet également d'en évaluer relativement facilement la portée à partir de nos données, tout en se concentrant sur l'application de leurs résultats à nos problématiques. Enfin, le traitement probabiliste bayésien est plus conforme aux techniques que nous voulons développer à long terme dans le cadre de ce projet (par exemple, pour la modélisation des choix de sujet d'investigation des chercheurs au cours du temps). Bien que les méthodes fondées sur les réseaux de co-occurrence aient largement démontré leur efficacité et soient mieux intégrées dans la tradition des STS et des humanités numériques, nous leur avons préféré les modèles de détection de sujet qui sont non seulement capables (en théorie) de capturer la polysémie d'un mot, mais aussi et surtout d'estimer quel est le sens le plus probable d'un mot selon le contexte. Cette deuxième faculté est inhérente aux modèles de détection de sujet mais moins évidente à reproduire avec un algorithme de détection de communauté. Or, elle est fondamentale pour évaluer les différents usages d'un même ``concept''. Il en va de même pour les techniques de plongement lexical, qui par ailleurs n'ont pas autant fait leur preuve pour la détection de sujet que les modèles probabilistes et la détection de communautés sur réseaux sémantiques.

In particular, we have chosen the Correlated Topic Model for its ability to capture correlations between topics. According to the Correlated Topic Model, the contribution of a topic $z$ to a document $d$, $P(z|d)$, is drawn from a hierarchical model involving a correlated multivariate distribution \citep{Blei2007}:%instead of a Dirichlet distribution as is the case in the simpler LDA model \citep{Blei2007}:

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:ctm_prior}
    \vec{\beta}_{d} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}, \Sigma) \\
    P(z|d) &= \dfrac{\exp \beta_{d,z}}{\sum_{i=1}^k \exp \beta_{d,i}}
\end{align}

Through the covariance matrix $\Sigma$, the CTM model is therefore able to learn correlation between topics, and therefore to account for the fact that some topics are more likely to occur together within one document. %Consequently not only the CTM is able to extract more topics than the original uncorrelated model \citep{Blei2007}
Moreover, our intuition is that using CTM allows the derivation of more realistic topic-distribution for short texts such as abstracts, for which the small amounts of words only moderately inform the prior topic distribution. Most importantly, this model allows us to directly assess the level of independence between the topics derived by the model, which is important for assessing the autonomy of the contexts in which supersymmetry arises.

The model is trained on $N=120,000$ articles randomly sampled from those between 1980-2020 that belong to any of the categories \texttt{Theory-HEP}, \texttt{Phenomenology-HEP}, \texttt{Experiment-HEP}, and \texttt{Lattice}. The vocabulary selection procedure and the procedure for choosing the hyper-parameters are described in detail in appendices \ref{appendix:data_selection} and \ref{appendix:hyper_parameter} respectively. Two methodological contributions can be highlighted. First, we included informative n-grams matching pre-defined syntactic patterns in the vocabulary in order to preserve more semantic information. Second, we made a prudent and balanced use of perplexity and topic coherence measures in order to recognize the advantages and limitations of both these kinds of measures for assessing the quality of topic models and choosing the best hyper-parameters.

\subsubsection{Interpretation and validation}

Once the model was trained, we manually assigned a label to each topic, by inspecting and interpreting their top-words and the categories from the \gls{pacs} classification of the physics literature that were most correlated to each topic\footnote{We used pointwise mutual information (see equation \ref{eq:pmi_expression}, appendix \ref{appendix:validation}) as the measure of correlation.}. Informing our interpretation of each topic with these correlations rather than the sole top-words help overcome issues associated with the interpretation of fat-tailed topic-word distributions based on a handful of top-words \citep{Chang2009,Allen2022}.  We failed to provide a meaningful label for some topics, but this little impact on the rest of the analysis. Finally, in order to assess the meaningfulness of the metrics produced by the model (the document-topic distributions and the topic-word distributions), we performed an additional validation procedure using the \gls{pacs} classification of the literature and the input of independent experts (see appendix \ref{appendix:validation}). 

In section \ref{section:application_plurality}, the model is applied to a number of tasks: the evaluation the contexts (i.e. topics) in which supersymmetry occurs in the literature, the extent of the correlation between these contexts and finally the trends in research involving supersymmetry since the start of the \gls{lhc}.

\subsection{Locating trades across scientific cultures}\label{section:method_trading_zone}


In this section, we elaborate a longitudinal methodology for locating trades between scientific cultures, which we use to assess the ability of supersymmetry to enhance trades between the theoretical and phenomenological cultures of \gls{hep} throughout time. Trading zones can manifest themselves in a myriad of ways, some of which are readily prone to a quantitative analysis. %For instance, ``trading between theorists and experimenters in the heyday of electron theories was done by mail'' \citep[p.~817]{galison1997image}. 
For instance, citing the example of quantum chromodynamics, a theory of the strong interaction, Galison notes that ``the contact between the experimenters and the phenomenological theorists had grown to the point where Andersson [a theorist] and Hofmann [an experimentalist] could coauthor a \textit{Physics Letter} \citep[p.~655]{galison1997image}. In that sense, a paper co-authored by scientists from different cultures is indicative of a trading zone, such that co-authorship data can in principle be used to probe trades across scientific cultures. Another manifestation of trading zones can be found in the citation network. That a phenomenological paper, for instance, cites a theoretical paper indicates that phenomenologists can acknowledge the value and significance of certain theoretical constructs in their enterprise. Although both the citation networks and the collaboration networks could be used for our purpose, the presentation analysis will rely on the former. Indeed, the citation graph preserves more information about the directionality of the exchanges involved thus supporting the trade metaphor in \citealt{Yan2013}. Intuitively, it is also less vulnerable to non-epistemic factors as is the case with authorship (e.g. physicists authoring papers they did not contribute to as is frequent in large collaborations in the field). In Appendix \ref{appendix:phenomenology_centrality}, we demonstrate that the citation network can indeed reveal the relative autonomy (self-reliance) of \gls{hep} subcultures, but also the special role of phenomenology in sustaining the unity of \gls{hep} by channeling trades across subcultures.

In order to assess the ability of supersymmetry to facilitate trades between theorists and phenomenologists, we develop a method that combines two important aspects of Galison's trading zones: their locality and their linguistic component (the ``inter-language''). In particular, we look for scientific concepts that are most likely to be involved in trades between these subcultures throughout time. To this effect we perform the analysis on a subset of the citation graph, such that the nodes are limited to theoretical and phenomenological papers, excluding cross-listed papers (those that belong to both these categories). For each of these two theoretical cultures, we derive a list of informative keywords from the abstracts of the papers by extracting $n$-grams ($n>2$) matching certain syntactic patterns. The extracted keywords are then sorted by decreasing ``unit-hood'' (see \ref{appendix:data_selection}), and we retain the top $N$ keywords such that at least 95\% of the abstracts contain at least one of the $N$ keywords; this yields $N=1370$ keywords specific to the phenomenological culture and $N=1770$ keywords specific to the theoretical culture. From this we derive a bag of words $b_{ik}$ for each publication such that $b_{ik}=1$ if keyword $k$ is present in abstract $i$, and $b_{ik}=0$ otherwise. We then evaluate the probability that the keyword occurs in an abstract given the paper is involved in a trade between a theoretical and a phenomenological paper at a time $t$, which we write $P(b_k=1|\text{trade}_{i\to j},t)$. We consider trades in both directions: phenomenological papers citing theoretical papers (th$\to$ph), then in a second time theoretical papers citing phenomenological papers (ph$\to$th). To what extent supersymmetry helps sustain the trading zone between these theoretical cultures is roughly measured by $P(b_k=1|\text{trade},t)$ for those keywords $k$ related to supersymmetry. In this analysis, we explore citations appearing in papers published between $t=2001$ and $t=2019$ (covering similar range prior and after the start of the \gls{lhc}), and we include all cited papers published from 1980 onwards; it is unlikely that recent papers would cite publications from before 1980. However, since cross-listed papers, which we excluded, have become much more common in the database starting from 2010 for spurious reasons (a change in the classification methodology), we ran a separate analysis in order to assess the robustness of our results. In this second analysis, we included cross-listed papers and assigned them only one category based on their authors' primary subfield (the subfield to which they contribute the most). We found both analyses to produce similar results. In the following we report the results obtained by excluding cross-listed papers.



\section{Results}
\label{section:application}

\subsection{Theory and phenomenology as distinct subcultures}\label{section:application_subcultures}

Let us now examine our first claim that ``theory'' and ``phenomenology''  should be regarded as distinct subcultures within high-energy physics. The claim requires that these categories mobilize distinct bodies of knowledge which manifest themselves through distinct vocabularies. As shown in Table \ref{table:categories_bow_prediction}, it is indeed possible to predict with reasonable accuracy whether a paper belongs to either one of these categories based on the vocabulary in its abstract. The accuracy is higher than 90\% for ``theory'' and reaches 86\% for ``phenomenology'', far above what one would obtain from assigning the most probable class irrespective of the contents. This supports the existence of a linguistic divide between these two theoretical cultures.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
               & Theory & Phenomenology & Experiment &  \\ \midrule
Model accuracy & 91\%   & 85\%          & 92\%       &  \\
Baseline       & 55\%   & 51\%          & 84\%       &  \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\textbf{Accuracy of the model for predicting which categories \gls{hep} papers belong to}. The precision of the model for each category is estimated based on the test corpus. For reference, the accuracy of a naive model that assigns the most likely class irrespective of any information about the papers is given (baseline). The size of the vocabulary used for the predictions is set to 500 words and expressions. }
    \label{table:categories_bow_prediction}
\end{table}

Our model also unveils the expressions that are most capable of discriminating between theory and phenomenology, as shown in Table \ref{table:specific_pheno_vocabulary_th_ph}. They reveal the vocabulary that is most responsible for the linguistic divide between theory and phenomenology. One striking difference between theory and phenomenology appears to be the importance of space-time related concepts in theory (``space-time'', ``geometry'',  ``manifold'', ``dimension'', ``coordinate'', etc.). The objects (entities) of interest also differ, which signals an ontological divergence: on the pure theory side, ``black holes'' and ``strings'' are prominent entities, while particles (``quark'', ``neutrino'', ``gluon'', ``hadron'', ``nucleon'', etc.) belong to the realm of phenomenology. Among those terms most specific to phenomenology but absent in pure theory (bottom-right cell), we also  find the notions of model (``mssm'', ``standard model''), and effective field theories (``effective theory'', ``effective field theory'', ``chiral perturbation theory'') which are approximate theories emerging from more fundamental theories. Interestingly, one aspect of supersymmetry (the \gls{mssm}) appears as markedly phenomenological, while ``supergravity'' is specifically theoretical.


\setlength\extrarowheight{2pt}\input{Table2.tex}


What about the ``demographic component'' of the divide between theory and phenomenology? Do these categories have social counterparts? The results of our social analysis are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ternary_categories}. % and summarized statistics are given in Table \ref{table:social_divide}. 
Figure \ref{fig:ternary_categories} is a ternary diagram in which each red dot represents a physicist and is positioned according to the relative prevalence of each category (among experiment, phenomenology and theory) among the papers they authored or co-authored. The majority of the dots are clustered near vertices, which means that most physicists dedicate themselves to mostly one of these categories. In particular, the inner part of the ternary diagram, which corresponds to physicists with balanced contributions to each category, is almost empty. We do find that some authors are scattered along the experiment-phenomenology edge and the phenomenology-theory edge; still, our results suggest that the category of phenomenology does feature a ``demographic'' counterpart as well, although it is more porous than experiment or pure theory. Therefore, phenomenologists do, to some extent, constitute a social group distinct from that of theorists; however, phenomenology seems to play a special role in sustaining some form of cooperation between experimentalists and theorists. Overall, we find that 81\% of high-energy physicists publish more than 80\% of their papers in just one of these categories, which is clear evidence of specialization.

Our quantitative analysis supports our claim that theory and phenomenology should be regarded as distinct subcultures with distinct languages. Consequently strategies ought to be devised for them to communicate and coordinate their efforts. It follows that their unity should not be assumed; instead, why a trading zone may be successfully worked out remain to be explained. Before we turn to the ability of supersymmetry to sustain the coordination between these subcultures, we will address the plurality of supersymmetry research itself.

\subsection{The plurality of supersymmetry}
\label{section:application_plurality}

In this section we apply our methods to address our second claim regarding the plurality of supersymmetry research and the recent decline in phenomenological supersymmetry research as a response to  \gls{lhc} results.

Topic models are able to link one word to several topics, thus allowing us to unveil different aspects of supersymmetry, i.e. different contexts\footnote{Like \citet{Allen2022}, we caution that these ``topics'' may not be as coherent as the common understanding of the word may suggest and that they should really be understood as different ``contexts'', although we use both terms interchangeably below.} in which this concept may occur. For three words $w$ that explicitly refer to supersymmetry (``supersymmetry'', ``supersymmetric'', ``susy''\footnote{Short for ``supersymmetry''}), we evaluated the probability $P(z|w)$ that these words occur in the context of a topic $z$:

\begin{equation}
    P(z|w) = \dfrac{P(w|z)P(z)}{P(w)}
\end{equation}

Where $P(w|z)$ is frequency of the term $w$ within the topic $z$, $P(z)$ is the marginal probability of topic $z$, and $P(w)$ is the overall term-frequency of $w$. The five most probable topics for each of the words ``supersymmetry'', ``supersymmetric'', and ``susy''  are shown in Figure \ref{fig:susy_usages}%\footnote{We stress again that the labels to each topic in these figures were assigned by us. However, one can assess their relevance with the help of tables \ref{table:emblematic_articles} and \ref{table:susy_pacs_pmi}.}
. We can see that each of these terms may indeed occur in relation to a variety of topics: ``supersymmetric theories'' (which entail supersymmetry in string theory, or supersymmetric gauge theories in general), ``sigma models (?)'', ``Higgs sector beyond the \gls{sm}'', ``supergravity'', ``Higgs boson'', ``supersymmetric particles'', ``flavor physics''. The meaning of the ``sigma models'' context is unclear, although it comprises most occurrences of terms relating to superspaces and superfields. These concepts are directly tied to supersymmetry. They arise from the abstract extension of space by introducing extra anti-commuting coordinates. Nevertheless it is notable that several of these topics are directly tied to supersymmetry (``supersymmetric theories'', ``supergravity'' and ``supersymmetric particles''). This stresses the importance of supersymmetry in the high-energy physics literature.

Moreover, although all these words (``supersymmetry'', ``supersymmetric'' and ``susy'') should refer to the same concept, we find that they are in fact related to different topics: ``supersymmetry'' seems to encompass more theoretical aspects of supersymmmetry (e.g. supergravity) while ``susy'' is more likely to occur in relation to supersymmetric particles (phenomenological supersymmetry). In fact, we find that 60\% of papers mentioning ``supersymmetry'' belong to theory (versus $\sim$40\% to phenomenology) while only 30\% of papers mentioning ``susy'' in their abstract belong to ``theory'' (versus 70\% to phenomenology).
% The fact that these terms may occur in different contexts is well summarised by Figure \ref{fig:susy_terms_cats}, which shows the origins of articles that contain these terms according to the categories ``Theory'', ``Phenomenology'', and ``Experiment''.
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Fig3.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{The many uses of supersymmetry}. For three terms $w$ refering to supersymmetry (``supersymmetric'', ``supersymmetry'', and ``susy''), the five topics $z$ that are most likely to have led to their occurrence and their respective conditional probability $P(z|w)$ are shown. ``Supersymetry'' and ``supersymmetric'' have similar distributions, and mostly occur within theoretical topics. ``Susy'''s topic distribution is much more peaked, and most often occurs within phenomenological topics.}
    \label{fig:susy_usages}
\end{figure*}

% \begin{figure*}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics{figures/analyses/terms_cats_english.eps}
%     \caption{\textbf{Categories of articles that contain specific terms refering to supersymmetry}. The plot represents the proportion of articles that belong to each of the categories ``Theory'', ``Phenomenology'' and ``Experiment'', depending on whether they contain any of the terms ``supersymmetric'', ``supersymmetry'', and ``susy'' in their title or abstract. Again, ``supersymmetric'' and ``supersymmetry'' mostly occur in theoretical papers, while ``susy'' more often occurs in phenomenological papers. The difference in the topics associated with the keyword ``supersymmetry'' and ``susy'' reflects the theoretical/phenomenological divide previously described.

%     \label{fig:susy_terms_cats}
% \end{figure*}

That these topics are at least partially independent can be assessed by inspecting the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of the Correlated Topic Model from which they were derived. We therefore compute the Pearson correlation\footnote{The Pearson correlation coefficients $R_{ij}$ can be deduced directly from the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of the CTM model -- cf. equation \eqref{eq:ctm_prior} -- according to $R_{ij} = \dfrac{\Sigma_{ij}}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{ii}\Sigma_{jj}}}$} between the seven topics most commonly associated with supersymmetry; the results can be found in Figure \ref{fig:susy_correlations}. Overall the correlations are close to 0, which suggests that these topics are rather independent, although there are a few exceptions. In particular, pairs of topics that belong to the same kind (theoretical or phenomenological) are moderately correlated; pairs of topics that are directly tied to supersymmetry (e.g., supergravity and phenomenological supersymmetry) but of different nature (in this case, theoretical and phenomenological, respectively) are less correlated.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \hspace*{-2em}\includegraphics{Fig4.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Correlation between the topics most associated to supersymmetry}. The Pearson correlation is comprised between -1 (perfect anti-correlation) and 1 (perfect correlation). A correlation close to 0 means that a pair of topic is partially independent, i.e. that they can arise or not in variable proportions in a paper.}
    \label{fig:susy_correlations}
\end{figure*}

From these results, one can see that supersymmetry is itself a diverse concept. It arises in a variety of partially independent contexts. In particular, theoretical and phenomenological aspects of supersymmetry are quite independent. How have these different aspects of supersymmetry responded to the negative results of the searches for supersymmetric particles at the \gls{lhc}?

In order to address this question, we evaluate the evolution of supersymmetry research in HEP since the first results of the LHC (2011) until today. For that, similarly to \citet{Hall2008}, we assess the relative importance $\hat{\theta}_{z,y}$ of each topic $z$ for every year $y$ from 2011 to 2019:

\begin{equation}
P(z|y) = \dfrac{1}{D_y}\sum_{d\in y} P(z|d)   
\end{equation}

Where $D_y$ is the amount of articles first submitted in year $y$. We then selected the three topics with the highest increase (hot topics) and decrease (cold topics) in magnitude over this period. For that, $P(z|y)$ was fitted to a linear time trend ($P(z|y) = a_zy+b_z$), discarding topics for which the correlation was not significant (i.e. $R=0$ is excluded from the 99\% CI). Then, the topics were sorted according to the best fit value of $a_z$, the rate of increase of its magnitude per year (similarly to what was done by \citealt{Griffiths2004}). We apply the procedure to  all papers mentioning at least one of the words ``supersymmetric'', ``supersymmetry'' or ``susy'' in their title or abstract in the years following the start of the \gls{lhc}. The results are shown in Figure  \ref{fig:hot_cold_topics_hep_2011_2019_susy}. 


\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Fig5.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Cold and hot topics among those that mention supersymmetry since the first results of the LHC (2011-2019).} On the left, the three coldest topics are ``Supersymmetric particles'', ``Higgs sector beyond the SM'' and ``Higgs boson''. On the right, the three hottest topics are ``Supergravity'', ``Amplitudes and Feynman Diagrams'', ``Conformal Field Theory''.}
    \label{fig:hot_cold_topics_hep_2011_2019_susy}
\end{figure*}

According to these results, the most rapidly declining topics among articles that mention supersymmetry are Higgs-sector related topics and phenomenological supersymmetry, i.e. phenomenological aspects of supersymmetry. By contrast, two of the (relatively) increasingly active topics are very theoretical (in particular, Supergravity and Conformal Field Theory). %\footnote{Among the three hottest topics is also ``Amplitudes and Feynman Diagrams''; although this topic sounds phenomenological, ``conformal'' is among its top words (cf. Table \ref{table:top_words}). Therefore, it it possible that this topic is confounded with ``Conformal Field Theory'' (since the presence of the word ``conformal'' increases the probability of both topics). The trends of these two topics do indeed seem correlated. The potential presence of such confounds is a potential shortcoming of topic models that one should remain aware of when interpreting results derived from them.}.
In order to understand these dynamics, it is therefore useful to distinguish theoretical supersymmetry from phenomenological supersymmetry. As physicist Mikhail Shifman argued in an early assessment of the first results of the \gls{lhc} in 2012, 

\begin{quote}
    [Theoretical supersymmetry] is an example of a complete success story. I use the word ‘theoretical’ to differentiate from ‘phenomenological’ supersymmetry [\dots] which [\dots] at the moment has a rather murky status. Theoretical supersymmetry proved to be a powerful tool with which to deal with quantum field theory, especially at strong coupling, a regime which was considered intractable for decades[\dots]. Progress in this line of research [\dots] is absolutely steady (\citealt[p.~6]{SHIFMAN2012})
\end{quote}

% In a later article, in the light of the latest \gls{lhc} results, \citet{Shifman2020} became even more pessimistic about ``phenomenological'' supersymmetry, while maintaing his appraisal of ``theoretical'' supersymmetry:

% \begin{quote}
% The [\dots] minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) no longer seems relevant, as well as the very idea of low-energy supersymmetry [...]. Basically, experimental data from CERN (or, better to say, their absence) ruled MSSM out. [...] The second face of SUSY – supersymmetry as a tool for exploring gauge dynamics at strong coupling – which started emerging in the early 1980s [10] is taking precedence over phenomenology. (\citealt[p.~7--8]{Shifman2020})
% \end{quote}

Shifman's assessment strikingly converges with the patterns that emerge from our analysis. Topic models reveal the plurality of supersymmetry in high-energy physics. They support that supersymmetry arises in different contexts, some theoretical and others phenomenological. They allowed us to demonstrate that these ``faces'' of supersymmetry have responded differently to the absence of evidence for supersymmetric particles at the \gls{lhc}. This supports that cultures can ``trade'' certain concepts (according to Galison's terminology) while retaining much of their autonomy\footnote{``trading partners can hammer out a local coordination, despite vast global differences.'' \citep[p.~783]{galison1997image}}.

% \begin{quote}
%     Two groups can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance to the objects being exchanged; they may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process itself. Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a local coordination, despite vast global differences. \citep[p.~783]{galison1997image}
% \end{quote}

In the next section, we investigate the contribution of supersymmetry to sustaining the trading zone between these theoretical traditions throughout time.

\subsection{Supersymmetry in the trading zone between theory and phenomenology}

Where do trading zones occur within \gls{hep}? As discussed in the Method section, citations can signal trades between subcultures. We apply the methodology proposed in Section \ref{section:method_trading_zone} for localizing trading zones. We measure the ability of certain concepts (keywords) to sustain trades through time -- most specially, exports from the theoretical subculture to the phenomenological subculture -- in terms of the probability that each of these concepts occurs in citations across these two categories of the literature. The results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cross_citations_probs_th_ph} and \ref{fig:cross_citations_probs_ph_th}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Fig6.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Inside the trading zone: probability that certain keywords appear in the abstract of a theoretical paper involved in a trade (a phenomenological paper citing a theoretical paper).} To the left, the five keywords are those with the highest peak probability of occurrence; to the right, are the five keywords with the highest probability of occurrence among supersymmetry related keywords. Redundant keywords (which normalized pointwise mutual information with a more frequent keyword exceeds 0.9) are excluded.} 
    \label{fig:cross_citations_probs_th_ph}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Fig7.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Inside the trading zone: probability that certain keywords appear in the abstract of a phenomenological paper involved in a trade (a theoretical paper citing a phenomenological paper).} To the left, the five keywords are those with the highest peak probability of occurrence; to the right, are the five keywords with the highest probability of occurrence among supersymmetry related keywords. Redundant keywords (which normalized pointwise mutual information with a more frequent keyword exceeds 0.9) are excluded.} 
    \label{fig:cross_citations_probs_ph_th}
\end{figure}

Both these figures show the probability of occurrence of the five most common keywords (left side) and the five most common supersymmetry-related keywords (right side) involved in trades across these subcultures (excluding redundant keywords). Figure \ref{fig:cross_citations_probs_th_ph} shows those probabilities for trades where phenomenological papers draw from theoretical papers. Three main trends are revealed: the fall of trades involving extra dimensions; the increase in trades involving black-holes; the decline of trades involving supersymmetry, despite a short increase after the start of the \gls{lhc} in 2010. Interestingly, in the early 2000s, ``supersymmetric model[s]'' had a trade-ability on par with that of that of the keywords most involved in these trades. Moreover, ``low energy'' appears to be one of the most frequent keywords in phenomenological imports of theoretical papers, which makes sense since the low-energy limit of theories of, say, strings and quantum gravity is what matters most from a phenomenological standpoint (it is what can be observed). Turning to Figure \ref{fig:cross_citations_probs_ph_th} -- trades involving theoretical references -- , we get an even more striking picture of the demise of ``extra dimensions'', which were involved in about 30\% of the trades in 2001 and went down to 5\% only. Similarly, ``weak-scale''  which refers to the domain of phenomena targeted by the \gls{lhc}, have become much less frequent in the ``trading zone'' (from $\sim$10\% of trades to $\sim$2\%). This suggests that phenomenological models dedicated to this domain of phenomena have become much less useful to the ``theoretical'' subculture over time. On the other hand, ``dark matter''\footnote{Dark matter refers to the observation that a significant fraction of the mass of the universe is currently unexplained.} is increasingly common in the phenomenological papers theorists draw from. This suggests dark matter is deemed valuable for the theoretical enterprise as well. This figure also confirms the overall decline of supersymmetry in the trading zone. As a result, supersymmetry is less able to connect developments from the theoretical programs to progress in the phenomenological program.

\section{\label{section:discussion}Discussion}

\subsection{Conceptually informed methods in quantitative science studies}

Before exploring the implications of this case-study, we want to emphasize that Galison's conceptual framework has been a fruitful guide for our quantitative approach. The linguistic component of his notion of subculture led us to build a bag-of-words model for measuring the extent of the divide between two theoretical cultures, and for unveiling the concepts that are specific to these cultures as well as their methodological and ontological differences. The social autonomy of these subcultures, too, can be readily quantified from authorship data. Furthermore, the notion of trading zone invited us to explore citations quantitatively (as a proxy of scientific ``trades'') while devising ways to determine their ``location'' in the semantic space. We also found that topic models can reveal the plurality of contexts in which a concept may arise, and how the dynamics of these contexts compare throughout time. Although we have applied our topic model approach to supersymmetry, in principle it can be applied to any kind of ``boundary object'', understood in the broad sense of a shared notion that allows some coordination to be achieved while preserving the distinctness of the scientific cultures at play. In the end, these methods illuminated our study of supersymmetry in high-energy physics, and provided further grounds for Galison's claim that unity is a contingent matter. 

% \begin{quote}
% String theorists work at the Planck scale, and their theories have unbroken supersymmetry, though they keep an eye open for how the supersymmetry might be broken. [\dots] Supersymmetry theorists like myself [\dots] think about physics at the collider scale, working out how to recognize that superpartners have been produced and how to take the quantities experimenters actually measure [\dots], and convert that information into the patterns that can be compared with possible implications of string theory. \citep[p.~133,Ch.~9,``Supersymmetry, String Theory, and the Primary Theory'']{kane2000supersymmetry}
% \end{quote}

\subsection{Unity challenged?}

  

The two theoretical subcultures we have distinguished -- pure ``theory'' and phenomenology -- no longer seem to value supersymmetry equally. Supersymmetry indeed fails to provide equally satisfying solutions to the heterogeneous commitments of \gls{hep} physicists, which poses a challenge to the unity of the field. Indeed, the example of supersymmetry shows that what drives theoretical progress may not drive phenomenological progress, in contrast with the expectations of the community regarding supersymmetry prior to the \gls{lhc} as surveyed by \citealt{Mttig2019,Mttig2020a}, and developments in these subcultures may become quite orthogonal.

Of course, supersymmetry is not the only channel of coordination between the theoretical and phenomenological cultures in their search for ``new physics''. Another channel, for instance, has been the notion of extra dimensions (see Figures \ref{fig:cross_citations_probs_th_ph} and \ref{fig:cross_citations_probs_ph_th}), i.e. spatial dimensions beyond the 4 space-time dimensions for which we have direct evidence. Extra-dimensions are required by string theory, but they are also subject to trades with phenomenologists interested in their observable consequences. However, no evidence for extra-dimensions was found at the \gls{lhc}. This further supports that the goals that drive theoretical research programs such as string theory (like the search for a quantum description of gravity) may not serve the phenomenologists' agenda so well.

% \begin{quote}
%     %Both experimenters and theorists want to push further toward a super unification.
%     Super experimenters want to construct super colliders [\dots]. Super theorists want to construct super theories of supersymmetries or superstrings to explain everything. This is no joking matter, for all are dead serious about these next steps toward the foundations of physics. [\dots] We may also have in all this excitement a test of the unity of physicists. (\citealt[p.~29]{Wilson1986}, cited in \citealt[p.~292]{Cat1998})
% \end{quote}
Eventually, the \gls{lhc} provided ``a test of the unity of physics''\footnote{ \citet[p.~29]{Wilson1986} (cited in \citealt[p.~292]{Cat1998}) used this expression in reference to the now aborted Super-Conducting Supercollider.}, and its verdict was ruthless. In the future, will a shared belief in unity be maintained, or will the socially entrenched divergences between these ``cultures'' of high-energy physics prevail?  We may assume that the challenge is merely transitory, and that theorists will eventually move to other theories which will be more successful from an empirical or phenomenological standpoint. However, the divergence between these theoretical cultures has become axiological \citep{Ritson2021,Laudan1984}, and it may persist as long as their differences in aims persist; as \citeauthor{galison1997image} puts it, ``there is no teleological drive towards ever-greater cohesion'', and ``fields previously bound [may] fall apart'' \citep[p.~805]{galison1997image}. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:mssm}, the aims of the theorists is to achieve the unification of the fundamental forces and a coherent theory of quantum gravity. By contrast, the aim of phenomenologists is to guide the experiment towards promising directions where evidence of ``new physics'' may be found. Both these aims may seem well-founded; however, there is no reason to expect that a simultaneous solution can be worked out. The apparent failure of supersymmetry to provide such a simultaneous solution does not undermine by itself the relevance of the ``theorists''' aims, nor does it undermine the methodology they deploy for addressing their goals (e.g. their trust in certain theoretical constraints, cf. \citealt{Galison1995}). It does, however, challenge the belief that such methods can provide grounds for progress to the field \textit{as a whole}; indeed, unification and quantum gravity might eventually not provide much reliable guidance to the experimental side; and conversely, it can very well be that the details of the theory ``at high energy'', where quantum effects matter to gravity, cannot be extrapolated from our knowledge of the low-energy theory, i.e. the one that we can probe in our experiments\footnote{More drastically, \citet{Cao1993} expressed the view that the theories at different energy scales (i.e. corresponding to different ranges of phenomena) are irreducible, and he argued for a ``pluralist view of possible theoretical ontologies'' while challenging the possibility of achieving a ``ultimate stable theory  of everything'' (p.~69--71). According to this view, the plurality of ontologies in physics is not an accident but the result of partially disconnected ``phenomenological domains'' through which knowledge cannot be deduced from one another. For a criticism of this view, see \citealt{Rivat2020}.}. Disagreements in the aims of a scientific enterprise may not always be resolved on purely epistemic ground, and a resolution, provided it occurs, may involve some sort of negotiation instead.  As long as theorists believe in the feasibility of their aims, they may pursue these aims even if it further isolates them from other cultures. Alternatively, they could decide that the schism should be resolved; as Galison puts it, distinct scientific cultures ``can [\dots] understand that the continuation of exchange is a prerequisite to the survival of the larger culture of which they are part'' \citep[p.~803]{galison1997image}.%In any case, it is reasonable to expect that non-epistemic factors may influence such ``decisions''.

% Finally, we would like to argue that the example of supersymmetry challenges a reductionist form of unity within the field. In such a picture, phenomenological models follow from the theoretical requirement of supersymmetry -- as prescribed by the more abstract theory of superstrings for instance. However, phenomenologists enjoy considerable freedom in the way they may implement supersymmetry in their models: supersymmetry itself is phenomenologically poorly constraining\footnote{As \citet{Borrelli2012} puts it, ``there is no ‘‘theory of supersymmetry’’, but only a number of different supersymmetric models''.}, to such an extent that supersymmetry cannot ever be ruled out. Conversely, even if evidence was found for the superiority of supersymmetric phenomenological models, this would not establish the supersymmetric nature of our world in itself, since, arguably, alternative models may have similar empirical success; to hold such a strong belief would require some prior readiness to ``accept'' supersymmetry, on non-empirical grounds -- e.g., because if fits so well the theorists' intellectual enterprise\footnote{Let us insist here that we do not mean that, if evidence was found for supersymmetric models, any claim for or against ``supersymmetry'' would be equally viable. It would then be silly to disregard the success of these models. }. In other words, there is no one-to-one mapping between the phenomenologists' supersymmetric models and the theorist's supersymmetry requirement. That the former provides evidence for the latter, or that the latter ``predicts'' the former is a matter of a rather symmetrical exchange (or trade) between these two theoretical cultures, rather than a matter of logical deduction. 

\subsection{Trading zones as a mean to sustain diversity}

More generally, the example of \gls{hep} and supersymmetry demonstrates how disunity can be endogenously produced in the fabric of science. Even initially tightly bound scientific cultures can diverge into quite distinct and autonomous programs, with different ontologies, methodologies and aims, as new domains of inquiry open up (e.g. quantum gravity) and warrant new modes of knowing. The extent of the coordination between disciplines will in general depend on epistemic factors (depending on how fruitful certain ``trades'' turn out to be), but also on non-epistemic factors: for instance, it may depend on the institutional setting, or whether such exchanges are incentivized or ``coerced'' \citep{Collins2010}.

Paradoxically, it can be noted that trading zones can stabilize the heterogeneity of cultures within a field, by sustaining the practitioners' beliefs that, in spite of the large differences in what they are doing, their respective efforts somehow support each other. If that is the case, there is no perceived need for a profound re-alignment of their respective practice. Trading zones can contribute, therefore, to a mutual process of legitimization of heterogeneous scientific practices, which is hardly tantamount to further unity. In order to further emphasize that, it is useful to come back to the example of \gls{hep}, and most particularly that of string theory, a highly theoretical research program driven by the pursuit of a consistent theory of quantum gravity. String theorists such as Matt Strassler have argued that even if string theory did not directly provide testable predictions to phenomenologists and experimentalists, it generated mathematical tools that could be useful to their practice, e.g. for predicting the behavior of quark-gluon plasma \citep{Ritson2021}. Consequently phenomenologists may have a low appraisal of string theory in terms of its ability to generate models for testing its assumptions about nature, while still recognizing the usefulness of what string theorists do for them, since some of their work is effectively ``applicable''. As \citet{Ritson2015} put it, ``if string theory has proved so useful for branches of physics whose scientific status is not in question, it can be argued it forms a legitimate part of physics''. Supersymmetry itself may be experiencing the same fate, considering that ``supersymmetry as a tool for exploring gauge dynamics at strong coupling [\dots] is taking precedence over phenomenology'' (\citealt[p.~7--8]{Shifman2020}). %\footnote{The need for legitimization may explain why popular books such as \citet{kane2000supersymmetry} or \citealt{randall_warped_2006} put so much emphasis on the complementarity of high theory and phenomenological physics, but also more generally the physicists' recourse to narratives connecting heteregenous developments in their field \citep{Borrelli2015,Borrelli2019}}.
Such trades do support the usefulness of the theoretical program to other endeavors, without necessarily implying further integration of the subcultures of \gls{hep} (ontological unity); just like successful interdisciplinary work does not necessarily amount to further integration of disciplines \citep{GrneYanoff2016}. 

% Coming back to Galison's framework, we have shown that both the linguistic and social dimensions of ``subcultures'' can be assessed quantitatively. In particular, text classification models like logistic regression can be used to locate the ontological and methodological divergences between certain categories of the literature. The social entrenchment of certain fields or subfields can also be measured by assessing how often scientists publish in one or several of them. This can also reveal which fields are less specialized (e.g. phenomenology). Parallel to that, topic models can reveal the polysemy of a scientific concept by unveiling the many contexts in which it is likely to occur. Although we have applied our topic model approach to supersymmetry, in principle it can be applied to any kind of ``boundary object'', understood in the broad sense of a shared notion that allows some coordination to be achieved while preserving the distinctness of the scientific cultures at play. Finally, trading zones can be explored through the combination of semantic and citation data of the literature. Citations across scientific cultures do indeed signal successful trades, and from the abstracts it is possible to infer which concepts allow such trades to be sustained throughout time.  

\subsection{Limitations and future work}

Before concluding we would like to hint at several directions for future work that could overcome certain limitations of the present methodology and further inform the question of the disunity of science.

First, none of our semantic methods distinguished between different kinds of words, i.e. which words refer to, say, methods (such as computation techniques) rather than entities  (e.g. strings, particles, etc.). It would be interesting to evaluate to what extent the coordination between theoretical cultures involves ontological or mere methodological trades, depending on whether the constructs of high-theory are referred to as the proper description of nature or as mere mathematical tools, and how this may have changed throughout time. %For that, named-entity recognition could be used to label methods  and entities in abstracts; then, the logistic regression model could be used to determine whether cross-cultural trades (citations across subcultures) are more or less sustained by shared entities or methods.
This might uncover evidence for a shift from an ontological to a more methodological coordination between the subcultures of high-energy physics, as the arguments for supersymmetry and string theory as ``tools'' rather than accurate accounts of the natural world suggest.

Another direction of future work involves the topic model approach. Although the topic model used in this work yielded seemingly acceptable results overall, some topics were difficult to interpret. In that respect, we made several improvements compared to previous works, by training the model on not just single words but also n-grams matching specific and presumably semantically informative syntactic patterns and by informing our interpretation of topics using correlations with a standard classification (rather than the top-words only). Yet, further improvements could be made. First, vocabulary selection could be enhanced by a better handling of mathematical expressions, for instance by parsing LaTeX formulas. The NLTK library picked up some of these expressions, and since they captured some information about the documents, we did not exclude them from the vocabulary; however, this way of proceeding does not preserve the underlying mathematical structure, although it may be valuable to distinguish references to, say, specific particles, or certain symmetry groups, based on their mathematical notations. We may also want the model to learn to discard uninformative words such as ``result'', ``parameter'', ``model'', etc.. In our case, we found such vague words to be clustered in three topics that we labeled as ``jargon'' which correlated very poorly with the standard classification (see Tables \ref{table:top_words} and \ref{table:full_topics_pacs_pmi}), but they should ideally not emerge as distinct topics on \textit{par} with more meaningful topics. To this end, we may want to build on \citealt{syntax_topic_model}, which provides a model that is able to distinguish between ``semantic'' and purely ``syntactic'' clusters of words without  prior knowledge of the language. A more critical limitation of topic models pertains to the challenge of hyper-parameters' tuning, considering it is unclear which performance metric should be maximized in the process. Although we proposed a procedure for choosing these parameters that accounts for known limitations to the reliability of perplexity or topic coherence metrics, non-parametric methods may provide a better answer to this fundamental issue \citep{Gerlach2018}.

% As we have framed this issue in terms of Galison's notion of trading zone, we would like to address two potential objections against its applicability to the case of supersymmetry. A first objection could be that supersymmetry has a precise meaning in the technical language of quantum field theory that is presumably shared by both the theorists and the phenomenologists, such that there is no problem of communication between the two groups and therefore one should speak of ``trades'' rather than of a ``trading zone'' \citep[p.~8]{Collins2010}. However this omits the fact that the task of deriving viable phenomenological models from supersymmetry tooks years, and that the abstract seminal work on supersymmetry did not enter the experimental practice seamlessly. Instead, this required the elaboration of a new jargon that was well captured by our topic model (see the topic ``phenomenological supersymmetry and superpartners'', Table \ref{table:top_words}). Another objection against the applicability of Galison's framework is that the example of supersymmetry does not contradict a reductionist form of unity within the field -- the very reductionist picture that Galison aims to disprove --, in the sense that phenomenological models follow from the theoretical requirement of supersymmetry -- as prescribed by superstring theory for instance. However, phenomenologists enjoy considerable freedom in the way they may implement supersymmetry in their models: supersymmetry itself is phenomenologically poorly constraining\footnote{As \citet{Borrelli2012} puts it, ``there is no ‘‘theory of supersymmetry’’,
% but only a number of different supersymmetric models''.}, to such an extent that supersymmetry cannot ever be ruled out. Conversely, even if evidence was found for the superiority of supersymmetric phenomenological models, this would not establish the supersymmetric nature of our world in itself, since, arguably, alternative models may have similar empirical success; to hold such a strong belief would require some prior readiness to ``accept'' supersymmetry, on non-empirical grounds -- e.g., because if fits so well the theorists' intellectual enterprise\footnote{Let us insist here that we do not mean that, if evidence was found for supersymmetric models, any claim for or against ``supersymmetry'' would be equally viable. It would then be silly to disregard the success of these models. }. In other words, there is no one-to-one mapping between the phenomenologists' supersymmetric models and the theorist's supersymmetry requirement. That the former provides evidence for the latter, or that the latter ``predicts'' the former is a matter of negociation (or trade) between these two theoretical cultures, rather than a matter of logical deduction. Even if one is not willing to concede this point, the case of supersymmetry shows that what drives theoretical progress may not drive phenomenlogical progress, which is already a form of disunity.

\subsection{Data collection}
\label{appendix:collection}

Our goal was to collect the whole HEP literature from 1980 to 2020. Data were collected through the public Inspire HEP API \citep{InspireAPI}. For that, we collected metadata for all articles through automated search requests, category per category, and year per year. This strategy was intended to abide with the limitations of the API, in terms of matching entries per search request. However, it appeared that many articles in years 1990 to 1995 were not categorized, and therefore our collection strategy missed many HEP articles from this period. In order to recover these articles, we gathered all articles that were referenced in publications collected through the first batch but which were missing. This methods fails to recover articles that were not cited in any article from the first batch. More importantly, 
the lack of categories means that selecting all HEP papers during the problematic time period will require unlabeled articles to be manually or automatically classified. Although there are ways to circumvent these issues and to assess their potential implications, we have decided to narrow down several analyses to years 2001 onwards in the present work.

\subsection{Topic model}


\subsubsection{\label{appendix:data_selection}Data and vocabulary selection}

The model is trained on $N=120,000$ articles randomly sampled from those in the 1980-2020 period that belong to any of the categories \texttt{Theory-HEP}, \texttt{Phenomenology-HEP}, \texttt{Experiment-HEP}, and \texttt{Lattice}. Titles and abstracts of each papers are concatenated in order to maximize the textual content used for training. Very short texts (less than 100 characters) are removed.

Before applying the model, we performed a number of pre-processing steps on the abstracts with the goal of maximizing the amount of useful information in the training data. This procedure, largely inspired from \citealt{omodei_tel-01097702} and implemented with the use of the NLTK library \citep{nltk}, is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tokens (words separated by punctuation or spaces) are extracted from the text and transformed to lower-case.
    \item All single nouns and adjectives are retrieved from these tokens.
    \item We also retrieve all n-grams that match specific syntactic patterns (e.g. ``adjective+noun+noun'', such as ``supersymmetric standard model'', ``effective field theory'').
    \item Single words are lemmatized, i.e. they are normalized to their root (e.g. ``symmetries'' becomes ``symmetry'').
    \item Words and expressions that occur less than 20 times are removed.
\end{itemize}

First, these steps allow us to reduce noise by removing words that convey little to no information about the topics of the articles (such as stop words). Second, extracting n-grams that matching certain syntactic patterns allows us to preserve some information about the relative position of words within the abstracts -- which CTM do not do otherwise -- while taking advantage of our prior knowledge of the documents' language. For instance, the word ``dark'' may convey different meanings depending on whether it occurs immediately before the word ``matter'', or, alternatively, ``energy''; similarly, the occurrence of the expression ``dark matter'' in a text conveys more information than the simultaneous occurrence of ``dark'' and ``matter'' without more knowledge about their relative position.

As a result of this procedure, the vocabulary contains $V=$ 18,658 ``words'', with 58 words per article on average.

\subsubsection{\label{appendix:hyper_parameter}Hyper-parameters}

The implementation of the CTM by Tomotopy \citep{tomotopy} has three hyper-parameters: the amount of topics $k$, an $\vec{\alpha}$ parameter that controls the sparsity of the document-topic distribution ($\theta_{d,i}$), and a $\vec{\eta}$ parameter that controls the sparsity of the topic-word distribution (the vocabulary associated to each topic).
For choosing the amount of topics $k$, we considered three values that seemed acceptable in terms of interpretability and compliance with the values from the literature: 50, 75 and 100.
We assumed $\vec{\alpha}$ and $\vec{\eta}$ to be symmetric, i.e. $\alpha_1 = \alpha_k = \alpha$ and $\eta_1 = ... = \eta_V = \eta$\footnote{This is common in the literature, but this choice is disputable, cf. \citealt{Wallach2009}. One implication of symmetric priors is that topics must have comparable probabilities. This also has an impact of the meaning of topics.}. We considered  $\alpha \in \{10^{-2},10^{-1},1\}$ and $\eta \in \{10^{-3},10^{-2},10^{-1}\}$, according to values encountered in the literature.
We then trained the model for each triplet of $k$, $\alpha$ and $\eta$ among the candidate values. We rejected all triplets that led to significant overfitting, by comparing the perplexity\footnote{Perplexity is the exponential of the average log-likelihood per word, cf. \citealt{Blei2003}. It measures the improbability of a corpus according to a given model.} obtained for the training corpus and that obtained by applying the trained model to a validation set of abstracts unseen during training.
Although \citet{Chang2009} have shown that perplexity could be negatively correlated to human judgments about the interpretability of the topics recovered by topic models, we believe it is a suitable metric to discard models that fail to capture meaningful regularities in the data, which is the case of models that show overfitting. Among the remaining models, we then selected the two models with the highest normalized pointwise mutual information coherence, a coherence metric frequently used to assess the consistency of topic models \citep{hoyle2021is}. Topic coherence metrics in general, as stressed by \citeauthor{hoyle2021is}, are not very strongly correlated with human judgments about the quality of a model; however, we believe they may be useful to discard certain models in order to limit the amount of those that should be inspected manually (since manual inspection is time-consuming and quite subjective). We finally inspect manually the two models with the highest coherence measure, and choose the one with $k=75$, $\alpha=0.1$ and $\eta=0.001$. Our preference for this model stemmed from the fact that it contained more topics than the other remaining model, and that these more numerous topics seemed reasonably consistent.

\subsubsection{Validation}
\label{appendix:validation}

Since the model infers document-topic distributions and topic-word distributions, we would like to assess the validity of these metrics, i.e. ``their ability to measure what they purportedly measure'' \citep[p.~3240]{Bannigan2009}. In order to simultaneously assess both measures, we designed the following protocol. First, we derived the \gls{pacs} categories $c$ that were the most correlated to each topic $z$ (this approach is in a sense comparable to that employed in \citealt{Griffiths2004}, who extracted the topics that were more strongly associated with PNAS categories). For that, we listed the categories $c$ that maximize the pointwise mutual information with each topic $z$ according to:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:pmi_expression}
    \mathrm{pmi}(z,c) = \log \dfrac{p(z|c)}{p(z)}% = \log \left( \dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{d \in c} \theta_{d,z}}{\displaystyle\sum_{d} \theta_{d,z}} \times \dfrac{D}{D_c}\right)
\end{equation}

Where $p(z)$ is the marginal probability of the topic $z$, and $p(z|c)$ the probability that a word in a document belongs to a topic $z$ given that the document was assigned the PACS category $c$. Thefore, $\mathrm{pmi}(z,c)$ measures the increase in probability of a given topic provided that a PACS category is present. The 5 categories most correlated to each topic are given in table \ref{table:full_topics_pacs_pmi}, which helped inform our choice for each tpic label, in complement to their top-words.

Then, we submitted the lists of PACS categories thus constitued to a human task derived from the methodology of \citet{Bennett2021}, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We draw at random a topic $z_1$ with a probability equal to its marginal probability 
    \item We draw at random 5 PACS categories $c_1,...,c_5$ among the 10 most correlated to $z_1$, as described above.
    \item Then, we do any of the following, with equal probability $1/2$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We draw at random another topic $z_2\neq z_1$ with probability $p(z_2)\over 1-p(z_1)$, and we pick at random 5 PACS categories $c_6,...,c_{10}$ among those most correlated with it.
        \item Alternatively, we draw  $c_6,...,c_{10}$ from the 5 remaining PACS categories most associated to $z_1$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item We submit $c_1, ..., c_5$ and $c_6, ..., c_{10}$ to an expert unaware of the model. The expert is asked to guess whether the two lists of 5 categories were drawn from one and same general topic, or whether they were drawn from two separate topics.
    \item The procedure is repeated a certain amount of times. The final score is the fraction of correct responses.
\end{enumerate}

The rationale for this method is that good scores should only be achievable provided the topics are rather coherent, and that the document-topic distributions $\theta_{d,i}$ are reasonably accurate. The final average score is 0.74 for 100 guesses from two HEP PhD students, which is significantly better than a random baseline (0.5). This shows that, to some extent, the topic distributions derived for each article correlate with \gls{pacs} categories that are rather coherent with each other. Now equipped with these results, we can turn to applications..

\subsection{\label{appendix:phenomenology_centrality}The centrality of phenomenology in bonding \gls{hep}}

We build a citation network where each node is one paper of the literature and the edge between nodes $x$ and $y$ is assigned a weight $w_{x,y}=1$ if $x$ cites $y$ and 0 otherwise. From this we can define the amount of citations of papers from the category $i$ to a paper from the category $j$ as: 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cite_matrix}
    n_{ij} = \sum_{x\in i, y\in j} \dfrac{w_{xy}}{(\sum_c \mathbbm{1}_c(x))(\sum_c \mathbbm{1}_c(y))} 
\end{equation}

Where $\mathbbm{1}_c(x)=1$ if $x$ belongs to $c \in \{$Experiment, Phenomenology, Theory$\}$, and 0 otherwise. 
We then normalize $n_{ij}$ by the amount of citations \textit{from} category $i$, thus yielding the normalized matrix $\tilde{n}_{ij}$. By construction, $0\leq \tilde{n}_{ij}\leq 1$ is the effective fraction of references from papers of category $i$ to papers of category $j$. The matrix is built from the citation network between 2001 and 2019. We then verify that $\tilde{n}_{ii}$ is high (papers mostly cite papers from the same category); and that for cross-culture citations ($i\neq j$), $\tilde{n}_{ij} \ll 1$ unless $i$ or $j$ is ``phenomenology''; i.e., ``trading zones'' in the field occur around phenomenology. Evaluating the fraction of citations from papers of a category $i$ that target papers from a category $j$ yields the matrix in Figure \ref{fig:cites_matrix}. In this matrix, borrowing the trade metaphor from \citet{Yan2013}, non-diagonal elements represent ``imports'' (references to publications from other subcultures) and diagonal elements measure the ``self-dependence'' of each subculture. The results confirm that most citations occur within categories, emphasizing the relative autonomy of each of these subcultures -- except for experimental papers, which are much more scarce then the others, and cannot cite themselves as much. Moreover the results confirm that most trades involve phenomenology: cross-citations between purely theoretical and experimental papers are very rare ($\sim$1\% of their references). Overall, ``theory'' is highly self-reliant.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Fig8.eps}
    \caption{\textbf{Origin of the references (citations) in the \gls{hep} literature}
    Each matrix element $\tilde{n}_{ij}$ represents the fraction of references from the x-axis category (columns) that target papers from the y-axis category (lines). For instance, 41\% of references in experimental papers refer to experimental papers. 15\% of citations from phenomenological papers refer to experimental papers. If these categories were completely hermetic, the matrix would equal the identity matrix, which is not the case.}
